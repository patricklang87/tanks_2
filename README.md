<h1 align="center">Tanks a Million!</h1>

<p align="center">To continue upskilling while on the job market, I a writing a clone of "Tanks," a childhood favorite. The frontend implements TypeScript, React, React-Redux, with the embedded JS Canvas API. I plan to add a Java backend to enable online multiplayer with websockets.</p>
